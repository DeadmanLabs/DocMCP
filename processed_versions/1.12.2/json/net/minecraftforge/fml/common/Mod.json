  "description": "This defines a Mod to FML. Any class found with this annotation applied will be loaded as a Mod. The instance that is loaded will represent the mod to other Mods in the system. It will be sent various subclasses of FMLEvent at pre-defined times during the loading of the game, based on where you have applied the Mod.EventHandler annotation. This is a simple example of a Mod. It has the modId of \"mymodid\", the name of \"My example mod\", it is version 1.0, and depends on FML being loaded. package mymod; // Declare that this is a mod with modId \"mymodid\", name \"My example mod\", version \"1.0\" and dependency on FML. {@literal @}Mod(modId=\"mymodid\",name=\"My example mod\",version=\"1.0\",dependencies=\"required-after:FML\") public class MyMod { // Populate this field with the instance of the mod created by FML {@literal @}Instance(\"mymodid\") public MyMod instance; // Mark this method for receiving an {@link FMLEvent} (in this case, it's the {@link FMLPreInitializationEvent}) {@literal @}EventHandler public void preInit(FMLPreInitializationEvent event) { // Do stuff in pre-init phase (read config, create blocks and items, register them) } }",
