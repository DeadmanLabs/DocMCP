  "description": "A `ConditionalAdvancement` is a single advancment file that contains multiple advancements, each having a condition. When loaded it will return the first advancement that the conditions pass. This allows for multiple variants of an advancement to share the same name in the registry. Which allows dependents to reference it without having to care about the conditions themselves. This is most likely useful when you have variants of a recipe based on what mods/resources are installed but want to maintain the same 'entry' in the advancement book.",
