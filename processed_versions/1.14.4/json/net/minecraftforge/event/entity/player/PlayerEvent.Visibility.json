The resulting visibility modifier is multiplied by the one calculated by Minecraft (based on sneaking and more) and used to calculate the radius a player has to be in (targetDistance*modifier). This can also be used to increase the visibility of a player, if it was decreased by Minecraft or other mods. But the resulting value cannot be higher than the standard target distance.",
