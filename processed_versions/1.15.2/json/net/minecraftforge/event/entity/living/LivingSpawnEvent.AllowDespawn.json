  "description": "Fired each tick for despawnable mobs to allow control over despawning. Result#DEFAULT will pass the mob on to vanilla despawn mechanics. Result#ALLOW will force the mob to despawn. Result#DENY will force the mob to remain. This is fired every tick for every despawnable entity. Be efficient in your handlers. Note: this is not fired if the mob is definitely going to otherwise despawn. It is fired to check if the mob can be allowed to despawn. See EntityLiving#despawnEntity",
