Called after RegistryEvent.Register events have been fired. Either register your listener using AutomaticEventSubscriber and SubscribeEvent or IEventBus.addListener(Consumer) in your constructor. Most non-specific mod setup will be performed here. Note that this is a parallel dispatched event - you cannot interact with game state in this event.",
