  "description": "Sided proxies are loaded based on the specific environment they find themselves loaded into. They are used to ensure that client-specific code (such as GUIs) is only loaded into the game on the client side. It is applied to static fields of a class, anywhere in your mod code. FML will scan and load any classes with this annotation at mod construction time. This example will load a CommonProxy on the server side, and a ClientProxy on the client side. public class MySidedProxyHolder { {@literal @}SidedProxy(modId=\"MyModId\",clientSide=\"mymod.ClientProxy\", serverSide=\"mymod.CommonProxy\") public static CommonProxy proxy; } public class CommonProxy { // Common or server stuff here that needs to be overridden on the client } public class ClientProxy extends CommonProxy { // Override common stuff with client specific stuff here }",
