Called after RegisterEvent events have been fired and before FMLClientSetupEvent or FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent during mod startup. Either register your listener using AutomaticEventSubscriber and SubscribeEvent or IEventBus.addListener(Consumer) in your constructor. Most non-specific mod setup will be performed here. Note that this is a parallel dispatched event - you cannot interact with game state in this event.",
