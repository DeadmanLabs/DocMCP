  "description": "When placed on a FIELD, the field will be set to an instance of Capability once that capability is registered. That field must be static and be able to hold a instance of 'Capability' Example: @CapabilityInject(IExampleCapability.class) private static final Capability<IExampleCapability> TEST_CAP = null; When placed on a METHOD, the method will be invoked once the capability is registered. This allows you to have a 'enable features' callback. It MUST have one parameter of type 'Capability; Example: @CapabilityInject(IExampleCapability.class) private static void capRegistered(Capability<IExampleCapability> cap) {} Warning : Capability injections are run in the thread that the capablity is registered. Due to parallel mod loading, this can potentially be off of the main thread.",
