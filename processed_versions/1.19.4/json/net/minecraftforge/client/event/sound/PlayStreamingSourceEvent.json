  "description": "Fired when a streaming sound is being played. A streaming sound is streamed directly from its source (such as a file), and used for sounds of long length which are unsuitable to keep fully loaded in-memory in a buffer (as is done for regular non-streaming sounds), such as background music or music discs. This event is not cancellable, and does not have a result. This event is fired on the main Forge event bus , only on the logical client .",
