  "description": "This is a special LoadingCallback that can be implemented as well as the LoadingCallback to provide access to additional behaviour. Specifically, this callback will fire prior to Forge dropping excess tickets. Tickets in the returned list are presumed ordered and excess will be truncated from the returned list. This allows the mod to control not only if they actually want a ticket but also their preferred ticket ordering.",
