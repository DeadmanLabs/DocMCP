  "description": "Marks the associated element as being only available on a certain Side . This is generally meant for internal Forge and FML use only and should only be used on mod classes when other more common mechanisms, such as using a SidedProxy fail to work. Note, this will only apply to the direct element marked. This code: @SideOnly public MyField field = new MyField(); will not work, as the initializer is a separate piece of code to the actual field declaration, and will not be able to find it's field on the wrong side.",
