  "description": "A method annotated with this will be called when a remote network connection is offered. The method should have two parameters, of types Map and Side . It should return a boolean true indicating that the remote party is acceptable, or false if not. When the method is invoked, the map will contain String keys and values listing all mods and their versions present. The side represents the side of the remote party. So if you're on the server, it'll be CLIENT, and vice versa. This method will be invoked both when querying the status of the remote server, and when connecting to the remote server. NOTE: the server will not be setup at any point when this method is called. Do not try and interact with the server or the client in any way, except to accept or reject the list of mods.",
