It is guaranteed to be able to send a custom payload packet, however, interaction with minecraft and world state is NOT assured as it is likely this is fired on a netty handler thread, not a world processing thread. If you wish to send an outbound message through your channel, bind the FMLOutboundHandler.FML_MESSAGETARGET property of your channel to the supplied dispatcher.",
