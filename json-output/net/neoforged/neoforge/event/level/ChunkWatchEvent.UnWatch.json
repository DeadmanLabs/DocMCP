The chunk this event fires for may never have actually been known to the client if the chunk goes out of range before being sent due to slow pacing of chunk sync on slow connections or to slow clients. This event is fired when a chunk is removed from the watched chunks of an ServerPlayer in ChunkMap.dropChunk(ServerPlayer, ChunkPos) . This event is not cancellable and does not invalid reference have a result . This event is fired on the main Forge event bus only on the logical server.",
